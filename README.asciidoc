= Microservices libraries comparison

== Purpose

This project is the companion of this Blog article: https://cdelmas.github.io/xxxxxxx.

== Build

To build the servers, just run `gradlew make` in the command line. By the way, you need a JDK 8, but I guess you're up-to-date :)

== Run the perf tests



== Notes

There are no unit tests, and it is fully assumed.

== The missing guys (again)

Feel free to add competing frameworks, such as Restx, Payara and Swarm to the comparison.
