= Microservices libraries comparison

== Purpose

This project is the companion of this Blog article: https://cdelmas.github.io/xxxxxxx.

== Build

To build the servers, just run `gradlew make` in the command line. By the way, you need a JDK 8, but I guess you're up-to-date :)

== Run the perf tests

1. Move inside the `perf-runner` directory
1. Each server has its own url :
+
- http://localhost:8081/dropwizard
- http://localhost:8082/restlet
- http://localhost:8083/spark
- http://localhost:8084/spring
- http://localhost:8085/vertx
+
Set the `SERVICE_URI` environment variable with one of these values. Run the corresponding server with `java -jar <project>/build/lib/xxx.jar`.
1. Run the Gatling scenario:Â `./gradlew loadTest`

== Notes

There are no unit tests, and it is fully assumed.

== The missing guys (again)

Feel free to add competing frameworks, such as Restx, Payara and Swarm to the comparison.
